    <h1>20-Year Discovery üå∏</h1>
    <p>"For years‚Ä¶ I was the ideal daughter, the ideal student the one who always listened, always obeyed."
    I wasn't becoming 'me'... I was becoming what they designed
    </p>And suddenly, I had the remote in my hands.
    But no one ever taught me how to use it".
    <p>You know‚Ä¶ when a bird is freed after being caged for years,she forgets how to fly.
      and I was that bird.
      I was that bird who forgot how to fly.
      
    </p>
    <p> But now,this time, I choose me 
    
    </p>
    <p>"I'm free... but I'm learning how to be free.<br>
Learning how to fly again.<br>
How to think for myself.<br>
How to feel without guilt.<br>
How to live ‚Äî not just exist."<br>
